# Football-Prediction

#Introduction

The FIFA designed Coca-Cola ranking system and was named 'SUM'. It uses metric that adds or subtracts points to the previous score instead of finding the average score. The lowest score which may be negative indicates the worst team while the highest score indicated the best team.
So in this model we will use two approaches polynomial and logistic algorithm to do our modelling to do our prediction.

##Objective

The objective of this model is to predict home team scores and away scores. we use two approaches 

Approach 1: Polynomial approach

What to train given:

Rank of home team
Rank of away team
Tournament type
Model 1: Predict how many goals the home team scores.

Model 2: Predict how many goals the away team scores.

Approach 2: Logistic approach

we use logistic approach to predict the outcomes of home team i.e home teamâ€™s perspective if the game is a Win, Lose or Draw (W, L, D)
